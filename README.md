This Algorithm is a path planning algorithm. This type of algorithm is commonly used in robotics and autonomous systems to plan efficient paths through a given environment. They consider the positions of obstacles and other constraints such as the drones' position and the need to avoid collisions.

This Algorithm explains that how drones positioned at different coordinates should fly so that they find the shortest path to reach the destination and also to avoid the collisions.
